# NOAA / NCEI World Ocean Database Parquet Format

## DISCLAIMER

This project is still in development and the schema presented is a draft version and subject to change.  Until this
project reaches a major version, 1.0.0 or greater, updates to this schema and library may introduce breaking changes.


## Introduction
This project defines the schema for the Parquet version of the World Ocean Database (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/world-ocean-database).  It 
also provides a Java object model implementation of the schema.  However, the schema itself is language agnostic since the Parquet file 
format is language agnostic.

The first part of this document will describe the schema and the second will describe how to use this library in Java applications.

## WOD Parquet Schema

### Background
The World Ocean Database (WOD) is world's largest collection of uniformly formatted, quality controlled, publicly 
available ocean profile data. It is a powerful tool for oceanographic, climatic, and environmental research, and the end 
result of more than 20 years of coordinated efforts to incorporate data from institutions, agencies, individual 
researchers, and data recovery initiatives into a single database. WOD data spans from Captain Cook's 1772 voyage to the 
contemporary Argo period, making it a valuable resource for long term and historical ocean climate analysis. Original 
versions of the 20,000+ datasets in the WOD are available through the NCEI archives.

More information on the World Ocean Database can be found at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/world-ocean-database.

The World Ocean Database can be represented in several file formats, including ASCII text, NetCDF, binary, and Parquet.
This document defines the Parquet format which was heavily influenced on the commonly used WOD ASCII format. Additional
information on the ASCII format can be found at:

#### cruiseNumber: integer (nullable = false)
In WOD18, a cruise identifier consists of two parts, the ISO 3166-1 country code and the unique cruise number. The 
unique cruise number is only unique with respect to the country code. For data for which there is no way to 
identify a specific cruise, a cruise number of zero (0) is used.

#### originatorsCruise: string (nullable = true)
The alphanumeric cruise identification provided by the originator. If the originatorâ€™s code is purely numeric, it will be found in second header code 7.

#### timestamp: long (nullable = false)
A representative timestamp of when the cast data were recorded as the number of milliseconds from 1970/1/1 UTC. If the 
day value was not recorded, this timestamp assumes the first day of the month. Likewise, if a time value
was not recorded, this timestamp assumes midnight UTC.

#### year: integer (nullable = false)
The year the cast data were recorded.

#### month: integer (nullable = false)
The month the cast data were recorded. Allowed values are 1-12.

#### day: integer (nullable = false)
The day the cast data were recorded. Please note that some data have been submitted with a day of zero (0) and we have 
kept these in the database as such.  Allowed values are 0-31.

#### time: double (nullable = true)
A floating point representation of the time the data were recorded as 24 based hours with fractional hours.

Ex.  13:30 clock time = 13.5 in this representation

#### longitude: double (nullable = false)
E / W degrees where the cast was recorded. Allowed values are -180.0 - 180.0.

#### latitude: double (nullable = false)
N / S degrees where the cast was recorded. Allowed values are -90.0 - 90.0.
